Russian Roulette is a simple game of chance, a bullet is randomly loaded into one of six barrels of a revolver and players take turns shooting. Some people believe that there is a statistical benefit to whether you go first or second. Some hypothesize that going first is better because each shot has a lower likelihood, however others hypothesize that there is a benefit to going second because you take each shot after the other player.

Here we investigate these myths and show that it doesn't matter which order you go in and that the result is a 50/50. In this repo I provide:

**1: A simple mathematical proof outlining the probability of each outcome**

**2: A statistical demonstration via a Monte Carlo Simulation**

**3: An intuitive perspective**
