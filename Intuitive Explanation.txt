Russian Roulette can be simplified to a roll of a dice. Consider at the start of the game there are six positions for the bullet to be.
The bullet is randomly assigned to one of the positions. Player 1 shoots on positions 1, 3, and 5. Player 2 shoots on positions 2, 4, and 6.
From here we can easily see how the game is a 50/50.
We need to remember to  only consider probabilities at the start and should not get lost in the noise of conditional probabilities at each state,
as those represent updated probabilities as the game progresses, not initial probabilities.
